Question 1. Why are ID selectors a bad idea? 
    In many cases, where an ID selector can be used, a different type of selector can also be used but without any special ID. Avoiding combinator selectors or pseudo-type selectors means that we're likely cluttering our code with unnecessary ID attributes.
Question 2. What selectors should you prefer when working with CSS?
    We should use class, combinator, pseudo-type or attribute selectors.
